DEPENDENCIES
============

You might need to install some of these before running the game:

  Python:     http://www.python.org/
  PyGame:     http://www.pygame.org/

(game tested on Python 2.7 and PyGame 1.9)

================

Open a terminal/console and "cd" to the game directory and run:

  python yaps.py



HOW TO PLAY THE GAME
====================

Arrows or WASD to move
P to pause
M to toggle music

Red apples give 1 point
Blue apples give 5 points (they disappear quickly)
Black Blocks appear casually on the map. Avoid them!
And last, but not least, don't eat yourself!


SOME INFOS
==========
This game is brought to you by Simone Cingano's not-so-skilled hands.

I took inspiration from Invention by XASM Studio to learn how
to program in PyGame (Thank you!)

This is my first game in pygame, and I know there is a lot of mess
in the code.

Anyway... let me give credit who deserves it:
