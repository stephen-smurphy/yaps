## DEPENDENCIES

You might need to install some of these before running the game:

  __Python:__     http://www.python.org/<br/>
  __PyGame:__     http://www.pygame.org/

Game tested on Python 2.7 and PyGame 1.9 on Linux and Mac OS X<br/>
(KNOWN PROBLEM ON PYTHON 3.0)



## RUNNING THE GAME

Open a terminal/console and "cd" to the game directory and run:
```python yaps.py```



## HOW TO PLAY THE GAME

```Arrows``` or ```WASD``` to move<br/>
```P``` to pause<br/>
```M``` to toggle music

Red apples give 1 point
Blue apples give 5 points (they disappear quickly)
Black Blocks appear casually on the map. Avoid them!
And last, but not least, don't eat yourself!


## SOME INFOS AND CREDITS

This game is brought to you by Simone Cingano's not-so-skilled hands.

I took inspiration from Invention by XASM Studio to learn how
to program in PyGame (Thank you!)

This is my first game in pygame, and I know there is a lot of mess
in the code.

Anyway... let me give credit who deserves it:

**Sound & Music**<br/>
