## DEPENDENCIES

You might need to install some of these before running the game:

**Python:** https://www.python.org/<br/>
**PyGame:** https://www.pygame.org/

Game tested on Python 3.9 and PyGame 2.0 on Linux and Windows<br/>

## RUNNING THE GAME

Open a terminal/console and "cd" to the game directory and run:
`python yaps.py`

## HOW TO PLAY THE GAME

`Arrows` or `WASD` to move<br/>
`P` to pause<br/>
`M` to toggle music

Red apples give 1 point
Blue apples give 5 points (they disappear quickly)
Black Blocks appear casually on the map. Avoid them!
And last, but not least, don't eat yourself!

## SOME INFOS AND CREDITS

This game is brought to you by Simone Cingano's not-so-skilled hands.

I took inspiration from Invention by XASM Studio to learn how
to program in PyGame (Thank you!)

This is my first game in pygame, and I know there is a lot of mess
in the code.

Anyway... let me give credit who deserves it:
